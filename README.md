This was my first group project and we decided to make a top trumps app. I was really happy with the outcome of this project, we managed to get a fully functional AI that would play against the user, that could have its difficulty changed. We also managed to perform significant CSS animations to allow our cards to flip on screen which was very visually pleasing. Reflecting on how we could have improved the app, I think that our html could have had better html tags. We used a lot of divs which aren't very accessible for those with screen readers. Doing this again I would start out with this in mind. I would also look to improve the amount of hardcoding that went on in the app in relation to the card attributes, as this meant we couldn't add new decks as we approached our project deadline, which was what we had originally planned. Overall though, a very successful project which taught me a lot and I'm excited for the next one.
