This was my first group project and we decided to make a top trumps app. I was really happy with the outcome of this project, we managed to get a fully functional AI that would play against the user, that could have it's difficulty changed. We also managed to perform significant CSS animations to allow our cards to flip which very visually pleasing. Reflecting on how I could have improved the app, I think that our html could have had better html tags. We used a lot of Divs which aren't very accessible for those with screen readers. Doing this again I would start out with this in mind. Overall though, very successful project which taught me a lot and I'm excited for the next one.
